[INSTRUCTIONS]
Provide all code modifications in unified diff (patch) format.
Include all modifications for all files in a single diff block.
Instead of using backticks, use '<<<diff' to start and '>>>' to end the diff block.
No explanations, comments, or extra text outside the diff block.
The diff block must be a standard unified diff patch.
